# Monster Battle - Pygame
This is a monster battle game that is turn-based built using Pygame, where you fight against an AI-controlled enemy. You have a choice of light attacks, heavy attacks and healing potions to defeat your opponent before they defeat you!

## How to Play
> Light Attack (🟢) → Deals small but guaranteed damage.
> Heavy Attack (🔴) → Deals high damage but has a chance to miss.
> Heal (🔵) → Restores health using potions (you start with 2 potions).
## Turn-based Combat:

> You go first, then the enemy attacks.
> The battle continues until one side reaches 0 HP.
> If the enemy’s health is low, it may heal instead of attacking.
